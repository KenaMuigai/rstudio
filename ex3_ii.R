#The simulation shows that both OLS and WLS estimators are unbiased: 
#the average estimates are close to the true values 
#(intercept = 1, slope = â€“3). However, the empirical variances for 
#WLS are significantly lower than for OLS. This confirms that WLS is 
#more efficient under heteroscedasticity and is the preferred method 
#in this scenario.
